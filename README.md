# Workshop_Thailand
Materials for workshop on basic genome-wide data analysis for Genetics Anthropology at Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand, Nov. 2023.
  
The workshop exercises are based on processing and analyzing a subset samples that were studied in our previous publication [Kutanan, Liu et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msab124). I did not upload the genotype files used in this workshop for two reasons: 1) they need to be controled for ethical reasons 2) the files are rather large. The key input files for exercise in R were all uploaded except the one for exploring missing data at variant level because of same file size issue as well. However,if you really wanna try out the whole practice, please send me an email (dang.liu@pasteur.fr) and I will arrange the file transfer given a DAC agreement is signed. Please also feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

You can find the whole instructions and exercises in __workshop_Thai.html__ or __workshop_Thai.pdf__. Also, you could run the __workshop_Thai.Rmd__ for all the R exercises!
